## Architecture

The project is organized into several packages:

- **`main`** - Entry point that starts the REPL
- **`internal/repl`** - Read-Eval-Print-Loop implementation
- **`internal/commands`** - All CLI commands and their implementations
- **`internal/pokecache`** - HTTP response caching system with automatic cleanup

### Key Features

- **Thread-safe caching**: Implements a concurrent-safe cache with automatic expiration
- **Probability-based catching**: Legendary Pok√©mon have lower catch rates
- **Graceful error handling**: Handles network issues and invalid inputs
- **Memory efficient**: Caches API responses to reduce network calls

## Development

### Running Tests

```bash
go test -v ./...
```

### Using the Build Script

The `build_and_run.sh` script provides several options:

```bash
./build_and_run.sh build    # Build only
./build_and_run.sh test     # Run tests only
./build_and_run.sh run      # Run the application
./build_and_run.sh all      # Build, test, and run (default)
./build_and_run.sh clean    # Clean up build artifacts
./build_and_run.sh help     # Show help
```

## Future Enhancement Ideas

Here are some ideas to extend the project:

### User Experience Improvements

- **Command History**: Add support for the "up" arrow to cycle through previous commands
- **Auto-completion**: Implement tab completion for Pok√©mon and location names
- **Colored Output**: Add colors to make the CLI more visually appealing

### Game Mechanics

- **Pok√©mon Battles**: Simulate battles between Pok√©mon in your collection
- **Pok√©mon Party**: Keep Pok√©mon in an active "party" and allow them to level up
- **Evolution System**: Allow caught Pok√©mon to evolve after meeting certain conditions
- **Random Encounters**: Add random wild Pok√©mon encounters while exploring

### Enhanced Catching System

- **Different Pok√© Balls**: Support for Pok√© Balls, Great Balls, Ultra Balls with varying catch rates
- **Pok√©mon Status Effects**: Factor in sleep, paralysis, etc. for catch probability
- **Berries**: Use berries to increase catch rates or calm Pok√©mon

### Data Persistence

- **Save Progress**: Persist user's Pok√©dex to disk to save progress between sessions
- **Multiple Profiles**: Support for multiple user profiles
- **Statistics Tracking**: Track catching success rates, exploration history, etc.

### Advanced Features

- **Enhanced Navigation**: Instead of typing area names, provide directional choices ("left", "right", "north", "south")
- **Quest System**: Add simple quests or challenges
- **Trading System**: Simulate trading Pok√©mon with NPCs
- **Shiny Pok√©mon**: Rare variants of Pok√©mon with different colors

### Technical Improvements

- **More Unit Tests**: Increase test coverage across all packages
- **Better Error Messages**: More user-friendly error reporting
- **Configuration File**: Allow users to customize settings
- **Logging**: Add structured logging for debugging
- **Performance Metrics**: Track and display API response times
